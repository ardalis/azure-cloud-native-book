# Introduction to Cloud Native .NET Applications

Welcome to the world of Cloud Native computing!

You first thought might be, "What exactly does that mean?"  Another industry buzzword concocted by cloud providers and software vendors just trying to sell us more stuff?"

On the contrary, it’s far different than that and hopefully this book will help convince you.

Within a short time, cloud native has become a driving trend in the software industry. It’s a new way to think about building large, complex systems - an approach that takes full advantage of modern software development practices, technologies and cloud infrastructure. It changes how you design, implement, deploy and operate systems.

Unlike the constant hype that drives our industry, cloud native is for-real. Consider the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/), a consortium of well over 300 major corporations, founded in 2015, with a charter to make cloud native computing ubiquitous across technology and cloud stacks.
The CNCF fosters an ecosystem of open source and vendor-neutrality. While we wholeheartedly embrace this vision and will present principles, patterns and best practices that are technology agnostic, the implementation provided in this book raise awareness of the services and infrastructure available in the Microsoft Azure cloud for constructing cloud native systems.

So, what exactly is Cloud Native? Sit back, relax and let us help you explore this new world and moreover how it ties to the Azure cloud.
